# riddler-20180803
Describes how I came across the answer for the Riddler Classic of August 3, 2018.

The **text** files are what I submitted as my answer.

The **WRONG** files are somewhat interesting, but WRONG.

The **Excel** files illustrate the tables I made to try to understand why the numbers are what they are.

The **correct** Python file requires `numpy`, but I think the version of the code I ended up only needs it for an array slice. I don't know how rewriting that part of the code would affect the speed.
